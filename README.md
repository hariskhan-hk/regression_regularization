# Regularization in Machine Learning: Ridge vs. Lasso vs. ElasticNet

This repository contains a practical comparison of three commonly used regularization techniques in machine learning â€” Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net. It includes a Google Colab notebook with code, visualizations, and concise explanations to help understand when and how to use each method.

## Contents

- Overview of regularization in linear models
- Python code implementation
- Coefficient comparison visualization
- Full article (linked and included as a markdown file)

## Article

This project is based on the following article:

[Ridge vs. Lasso vs. Elastic Net: Which Regularization Technique Should You Use?](https://medium.com/@hariskhan_hk/ridge-vs-lasso-vs-elastic-net-which-regularization-technique-should-you-use-19a4b81ace72)

If Medium is unavailable, a copy of the article is available in `article.md`.

## Colab Notebook

You can view and run the code in Google Colab:
